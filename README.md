# AI vs Real Image Classifier ðŸ§ ðŸ“¸

This project aims to classify whether an image is AI-generated or real using a convolutional neural network with transfer learning (ResNet18). As generative models like DALLÂ·E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion become more advanced, itâ€™s increasingly difficult to distinguish synthetic images from authentic ones. This tool addresses that challenge by providing image classification along with a confidence score.

## ðŸ”§ Planned Features
- Image classification (Real vs AI-generated)
- Saliency map visualization for model interpretability
- Performance evaluation using precision-recall curves, F1 score, and accuracy
- Balanced dataset from real and AI sources

## ðŸ“Œ Status
This project is currently in development â€” check back for updates soon!

## ðŸ§  Motivation
As someone deeply interested in machine learning and the ethics of AI, I built this to explore how technology can be used to fight misinformation and improve digital literacy.
